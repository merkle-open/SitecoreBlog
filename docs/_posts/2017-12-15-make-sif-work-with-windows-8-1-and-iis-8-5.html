<p>If you found all your way to this article, chances are you ran into the following error during installation of Sitecore 9.0: "Cannot bind argument to parameter 'Signer' because it is null."</p>

<p><a href="https://neilkillen.com/2017/11/04/sitecore-9-0-sif-windows-8-1-server-2012-gotchas/">Neil Killen already stated</a>&nbsp;that the Sitecore Fundmentals and therefore also the Sitecore Installation Framework (SIF)&nbsp;do&nbsp;not support Windows 8.1 / IIS 8.5. The problem here is that Sitecore Fundamentals internally use some Windows PowerShell&nbsp;Cmdlets which might differ from one version to another. More precisely, in this very situation it uses the New-SelfSignedCertificate Cmdlet. If we compare this in both&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/pkiclient/new-selfsignedcertificate?view=win10-ps">Windows 10</a> and <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh848633(v=wps.630)">Windows 8.1</a> it&nbsp;becomes obvious why this error happens after all. The&nbsp;parameter "Signer" and various other parameters are not present in the Windows 8.1 version.</p>
<p>Warning: The following fix is not meant for production use. It only supplements your local environment setup.</p>
<h3>How to fix this issue</h3>
<p><strong>1. Create a self-signed certificate in Windows 8.1</strong></p>
<p>As the name of the Cmdlet mentioned before already tells us, it tries to create a self-signed certificate. As we cannot rely on Sitecore Fundamentals to perform this task for us, we need to do it ourselves.&nbsp;Luckily <a href="https://kamsar.net/index.php/2017/10/Quickly-add-SSL-to-Solr/">Kam Figy already&nbsp;provides a great script</a> for securing your Solr server. I&nbsp;made some slight changes to this script in order to meet our requirement (e.g. SIF requires read permissions to the private key of the certificate) and converted it to a SIF task.&nbsp;Download&nbsp;New-SignedCertificateWindows81.ps1 and save it to the folder where the script from the&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.sitecore.net">Sitecore 9 installation guide</a> (section 5.2.1) is located.<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/NaibafCH/431acc78ea4078a3c86228c0eb6f7533.js"></script></p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;Change&nbsp;xconnect-createcert.json</strong></p>
<p>We need to integrate the&nbsp;New-SignedCertificateWindows81.ps1 script into SIF.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open&nbsp;xconnect-createcert.json and change&nbsp;task "CreateSignedCert" as shown below</li>
<li>Register the new module as shown below</li>
</ol>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/NaibafCH/d35def58028e2ad2adaa53f889efe51b.js"></script></p>
<p><strong>3. Change the official installation script</strong></p>
<p>In our main script which is provided by the&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.sitecore.net">Sitecore 9 installation guide</a>&nbsp;(section 5.2.1) we need to do two slight changes.</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove the suffix "_client" from variable $certParams.CertificateName</li>
<li>Add a new property SSLCert in variable&nbsp;$xconnectParams</li>
</ol>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/NaibafCH/9e04d83268cfc227beff68a17d167349.js"></script></p>
<p>Now, you should be able to run the official installation script without errors regarding certificate handling. If you have any problems then let me know in the comments down below.</p>
