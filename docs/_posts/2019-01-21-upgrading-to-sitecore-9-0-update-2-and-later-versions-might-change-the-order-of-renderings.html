excerpt: After running the Update Installation Wizard for a Sitecore solution from
  Sitecore 8.1 Update-1 to Sitecore 9.0 Update-2 we discovered that the order of most
  of the renderings on page items had changed. Beforehand we already tested an upgrade
  with Sitecore 9.0 Update-1 for this solution and it worked perfectly fine. This
  implied that something must have changed between Sitecore 9 Update-1 and Update-2.

<p>I am currently in the process of upgrading one of our customer's solutions from Sitecore 8.1 Update-1 to Sitecore 9.0 Update-2. After running the Update Installation Wizard I discovered that the order of most of the renderings on page items had changed in comparison to Sitecore 8.1. Beforehand we already tested an upgrade with Sitecore 9.0 Update-1 for this solution and it worked perfectly fine there. This implied that something must have changed between Sitecore 9 Update-1 and Update-2. After some time I found <a href="https://kb.sitecore.net/articles/672981">this helpful article</a> in the Sitecore knowledge base which explains this behaviour (previously only covered Sitecore 8.2 Update-7). Turns out that Sitecore has changed the parsing logic of the layout information.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>I checked the release dates of all the previous Sitecore versions and I think that you will run into this problem if you want to upgrade from one of the following versions:</p>
<ul>
<li>All versions prior to Sitecore 8.1</li>
<li>Sitecore 8.1 Initial Release</li>
<li>Sitecore 8.1 Update-1</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to fix this problem you have to perform the following steps:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Update 15.02.2019:</strong> The gist has been updated due to a bug. The script automatically created an item version in the context language (most likely "en") when the shared layout field was modified.</p></blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Backup the affected database(s)</li>
<li>Install a clean instance of Sitecore 8.1 Update-2.<br />
The easiest way to do this is to use <a href="http://dl.sitecore.net/updater/sim/">SIM</a>.</li>
<li>Change the connection strings of your clean solution to point to the affected database(s).</li>
<li>Copy the admin page below to your clean solution</li>
<li>Change the setting <em>Query.MaxItems</em> to a high value which should be higher than the amount of page items you need to migrate (e.g. 10000)</li>
<li>Run the script with the according parameters<br />
(e.g. /sitecore/admin/MigrateLayouts.aspx?database=master&itemId={0DE95AE4-41AB-4D01-9EB0-67441B7C2450}&enableRecursion=true)</li>
</ol>
